Question 1.
Exponential Distribution Scheduler
Advantages - 
	->Removes starvation of processes with lower priority
	->Since the method for scheduling a process is randomized, the scheduler is 
	somewhat fair towards each priority and depends on the lambda value.
Disadvantages - 
	->Although the scheduling is randomized, processes with lower priority have 
	a higher chance of getting scheduled

Linux Like Scheduler
Advantages - 
	->Removes the problem of starvation of processes with lower priority
	->Introduces fairness among processes and every process is guaranteed to run
	within an epoch and complete its quantum unless suspended, in which case, it
	can carry forward half of the remaining quantum in the next epoch.
Disadvantages - 
	->Since the quantum depends on the priority, the processes with small priority
	will finish last. 
	->The overhead involved in reschudling and finding the process with maximum goodness
	value is high.
Default Round Robin Scheduler
Advantages - 
	->No computational overhead for rescheduling
Disadvantages - 
	->Starvation of processes with low priority if higher priority processes	
	keep getting spawned

Question 2.
In both the schedulers, the null process is scheduled only when there are no other processes
in the ready queue.
